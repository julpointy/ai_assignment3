CS 4341 Assignment 3

To run the program, edit the command line arguments, where the first argument is the heuristic chosen to run the
algorithm with (1-7), and the second argument is the name of the text file containing the board (a series of numbers
separated by tabs). The file name cannot contain spaces.

We also have a method within our project that automatically creates boards of a coded size that will edit the file
named board.txt

Please also change directory path within main, tester, and boardGenerator class to run the algorithm.
The path to the file containing the board must be provided in Main.java 3 locations:
Main.java: Line 39
Tester.java: Line 19 and Line 42

The path to the output of the data collection must be provided in 1 location:
BoardGenerator.java: Line 30
